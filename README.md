# leistrack-cs
 App that tracks your time spent on subjects. 
 
 The most notable feature is "time/realtime". For instance you could say that you've spent 60 minutes studying biology, but your mind wanders or you check your FB, IG, etc. constantly. In that case you could say that the time spent on biology is 60 minutes, but the actual time spent studying seriously was ~40 minutes. 
 
 When first launching the app, you are greeted with a setup process which determines your grade, what subjects you will keep track of and when does the school start (or when has it started).
 After the setup it's up to you to log your progress :)
 
 In order to get a detailed information about a command, just type it alone without additional arguments (subcommands).
 
 The commands currently available are 
 1) subject commands - i.e. if you have MATH as a subject, MATH becomes a subject command. With the subject subcommands you can track your progress.
 2) setdate - changes you current date (in the app).
 3) info - logs the progress for the current day.
 4) period - logs the progress over a period.
 5) quit - **whether to save all changes** and closes the app
